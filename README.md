# My Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! 
Here, I showcase the projects I’ve built using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript** and **Firebase**.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For building the structure of the pages.
- **CSS**: For styling and creating a responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity to the projects.
- **Firebase**: For real-time databases.

## Projects
1. **Result Summary Component**: This project is a Result Summary Component, designed using only HTML and CSS. It replicates a visually appealing UI element commonly found in modern web applications.
2. **Tic-Tac-Toe**: Tic Tac Toe is a classic 3x3 grid-based game built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, enhanced with an optional AI opponent. The game allows users to play against a computer opponent with three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium and Hard. The AI feature adds a layer of complexity, making the gameplay engaging for users of all skill levels
3. **Budget Tracker**: A web-based budget tracker that helps you track your income and expenses using Firebase. It includes warnings when you overspend and provides a visual report chart of your budget.

Each project is crafted with a focus on user experience, clean code, and functionality.
