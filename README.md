# My Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! Here, I showcase the projects I’ve built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For building the structure of the pages.
- **CSS**: For styling and creating a responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity to the projects.

## Projects
1. **Result Summary Component**: This project is a Result Summary Component, designed using only HTML and CSS. It replicates a visually appealing UI element commonly found in modern web applications.
2. **Tic-Tac-Toe**: 
3. **Project 3**: A brief description of what the project is about.
4. **Project 4**: A brief description of what the project is about.
5. **Project 5**: A brief description of what the project is about.

Each project is crafted with a focus on user experience, clean code, and functionality.
